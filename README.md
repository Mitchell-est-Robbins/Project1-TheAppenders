# Retail Therapy* is an app that that helps people who are feeling lost, down, or sad, and want to treat themselves to a relaxing 
shopping experience, that will help lift their mood. While shopping on our website you have access to *Amazon* products, and a
Motivational Quote Generator. 

### How to use?
When first visiting our website, you will first be presented with our landing page. To search for any product you may want, you can click 
the search bar with your curser and enter the products name, then click on the search button found on the right at the end of the search 
bar. You will then be re-directed to our search-results page that contains a grid of products from *Amazon*, that match your search.
On each product card, you will see the title of the product, the *Amazon Product Rating*, sale price, a link to the specific product on 
*Amazon*, and the amount of reviews the product has on *Amazon*. On the same search-results page, on the left hand side, you will be 
presented with a small form, so you can continue shopping, and looking for other products. Below that small form, you will see a blue 
"Motivate Me!" button, you can click that button for great, mood-modifying, motivational quotes. You can click this button as many times as you 
would like and a different quote will appear each time.
